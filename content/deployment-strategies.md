# Deployment Strategies for Nuxt Applications

Nuxt applications can be deployed in various ways depending on your needs and infrastructure.

## Static Site Generation

Generate a fully static site that can be deployed to any CDN or static hosting service.

## Server-Side Rendering

Deploy with SSR for dynamic content and better SEO while maintaining fast page loads.

## Serverless Deployment

Deploy to serverless platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Lambda for automatic scaling.
