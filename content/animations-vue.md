# Creating Smooth Animations in Vue

Animations can greatly enhance user experience when done right. Vue provides excellent tools for creating smooth animations.

## Transition Component

Use Vue's `<Transition>` component to add enter/leave transitions to elements and components.

## Animation Libraries

Integrate popular animation libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion for complex animations.

## Performance Tips

Keep animations performant by using CSS transforms and opacity, and avoid animating layout properties.
