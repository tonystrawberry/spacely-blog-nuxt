# Creating API Routes in Nuxt

Nuxt allows you to create API routes alongside your frontend code, making full-stack development easier.

## Server Routes

Create API endpoints in the `server/api` directory. Nuxt will automatically register them.

## Request Handling

Handle different HTTP methods and parse request data properly.

## Database Integration

Connect to databases and perform CRUD operations in your API routes.
